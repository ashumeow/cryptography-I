<b>Question:</b>
```
An attacker intercepts the following ciphertext (hex encoded): 
```
```
   20814804c1767293b99f1d9cab3bc3e7 ac1e37bfb15599e5f40eef805488281d 
```
```
He knows that the plaintext is the ASCII encoding of the message "Pay Bob 100$" (excluding the quotes). 
He also knows that the cipher used is CBC encryption with a random IV using AES as the underlying block cipher. 
Show that the attacker can change the ciphertext so that it will decrypt to "Pay Bob 500$". 
What is the resulting ciphertext (hex encoded)? This shows that CBC provides no integrity.
