<b>QUESTION 1:</b>
```
Your goal in this project is to break RSA when the public modulus N is generated incorrectly. 
This should serve as yet another reminder not to implement crypto primitives yourself. 
```
```
Normally, the primes that comprise an RSA modulus are generated independently of one another. 
But suppose a developer decides to generate the first prime p by choosing a random number R and scanning for a prime close by. 
The second prime q is generated by scanning for some other random prime also close to R. 
We show that the resulting RSA modulus N=pq can be easily factored. 
```
```
Suppose you are given a composite N and are told that N is a product of two relatively close primes p and q, namely p and q satisfy 
   |p−q|<2N^1/4    (*) 
Your goal is to factor N. 
```
```
Let A be the arithmetic average of the two primes, that is A=(p+q)/2. 
Since p and q are odd, we know that p+q is even and therefore A is an integer. 
```
```
To factor N you first observe that under condition (*) the quantity √N is very close to A. In particular 
   A − √N < 1 
as shown below. 
```
```
But since A is an integer, rounding √N up to the closest integer reveals the value of A. 
In code, A=ceil(sqrt(N)) where "ceil" is the ceiling function. 
Visually, the numbers p,q,√N and A are ordered as follows:
```
```
Since A is the exact mid-point between p and q there is an integer x such that p=A−x and q=A+x. 
But then 
   N=pq=(A−x)(A+x)=A2−x2 and therefore x=A^2−√N
Now, given x and A you can find the factors p and q of N since p=A−x and q=A+x. 
```
```
In the following challenges, you will factor the given moduli using the method outlined above. 
To solve this assignment it is best to use an environment that supports multi-precision arithmetic and square roots. 
In Python you could use the gmpy2 module. 
In C you can use GMP. 
```

The following modulus N is a products of two primes p and q where |p−q|<2N^1/4.

Factoring challenge #2: 
The following modulus N is a products of two primes p and q where |p−q|<2^11 N^1/4. 
Find the smaller of the two factors and enter it as a decimal integer.
Hint: in this case A−√N<2^20 so try scanning for A from √N upwards, until you succeed in factoring N.

Factoring challenge #3: (extra credit) 
The following modulus N is a products of two primes p and q where |3p−2q|<N^1/4. 
Find the smaller of the two factors and enter it as a decimal integer. 
Hint: use the calculation below to show that √6N is close to 3p+2q2 and then adapt the method above to factor N.

The only remaining mystery is why A−√N<1. 
This follows from the following simple calculation. 

First observe that 
   A^2−N=((p+q)/2)^2−N
        =((p^2+2N+q^2)/4)−N
        =(p^2−2N+q^2)/4=((p−q)^2)/4 

Now, since for all x,y:  (x−y)(x+y)=x^2−y^2 
we obtain 
   A−√N=(A−√N) X (A-√N)/(A-√N)=(A^2−N)/A+√N=((p−q)^2/4)/(A+√N)

and since √N≤A it follows that 
   A−√N≤((p−q)^2/4)/2√N=((p−q)^2)/8√N 

By assumption (*) we know that (p−q)2<4√N and therefore 
   A−√N≤4√N/8√N=1/2 
as required. 
```

The method described above is a greatly simplified version of a much more general result on factoring when the high order bits of the prime factor are known.
